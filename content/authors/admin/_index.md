Hello and welcome! My name is Shaohang Han. I am a PhD student within the [Division of Robotics, Perception, and Learning](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/en/eecs) of [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/). I have the privilege of being supervised by [Jana Tumova](https://sites.google.com/view/janatumova/home) and [Dimos V. Dimarogonas](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/), who are guiding me through my journey in risk-aware motion planning and control. Our aim is to enhance autonomous systems with the ability to not only execute tasks efficiently but also to do so with formal guarantees of safety and reliability.
